\title{Simulating a Vector Error Correction Model}
\usage{
bvar.sim(len, M, plag=1, cons=FALSE, trend=FALSE, SV=FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{len}{length of the simulated time series.}

\item{M}{number of endogenous variables.}

\item{plag}{number of lags.}

\item{cons}{logical indicating whether to include an intercept. Default set to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{trend}{logical indicating whether to include an intercept. Default set to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{SV}{logical indicating whether the process should be simulated with or without stochastic volatility. Default set to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Returns a list with the following elements
}
\description{
This function is used to produce simulated realizations which follow a Vector error correction model. It will also automatically simulate coefficients. All parameters can also be set by the user.
}
\details{
For testing purposes, this function enables to simulate time series processes which can be described by a Global Vector Autoregression. Since stability conditions are not checked, it is only implemented for \code{M=3}.

\examples{
len <- 1000
M <- 3
plag <- 1
include <- "none"
B <- rbind(c(0.7, 0, 0, 0.4), c(0.6, -0.5, 0.2, 0), c(0.2, 0, 0.4, 0.9))
beta <- c(1,-1,-1)
yb <- bvec.sim(len=len, M=M, B=B, beta=beta, plag=plag, include=include)
